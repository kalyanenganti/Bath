This is a Bath Tub Test that is kind of a pre interview coding test.I  have tried to build the app as closely as possible 
in accordance with the design specified.
I have built and tested the app on a 3.7 inch android device using api 'level 11' emulator.
I have used eclipse on a mac to design the app.The tests are not an exhaustive list, as I have concentrated on the UI part.
