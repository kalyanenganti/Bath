This is a 'Bath Tub Test', it's a pre interview test for getting an interview with 'AKQA'.
I  have tried to build the app as closely as possible in accordance with the design specified.
I have built and tested the app on a 3.7 inch android device using api 'level 11' emulator.
I have used eclipse on a mac to design the app.The tests are not an exhaustive list, as I have concentrated more on the UI part.
